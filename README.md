All rights reserved.

## 1. Basic Model ##

We built our poetry generator with GroundHog, more details of the Gated Unit RNN model please refer to <https://github.com/lisa-groundhog/GroundHog>

## 2. Setting ##

All needed source codes are in the directory GroundHogAttention. We did a few changes on the source codes, thus they are not totally same as the original GroundHog.

Please add GroundHogAttention to python path, then preprocess your poetry corpus with the tools in GroundHogAttention/experiments/nmt/preprocess. More details please refere to <https://github.com/lisa-groundhog/GroundHog>.

You can put your training data (mainly the vocabulary) , and the model file, e.g. search_model.npz and the config file, e.g. search_state.pkl in GroundHogAttention/experiments/nmt/SPB/ and run generate.py to generate poetry lines.

## 3. Other Blocks ##
Other Blocks described in our paper, such as CPB and WPB, can be easily got by changing the training data.
